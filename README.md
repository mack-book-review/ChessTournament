# Chess Tournament Organizer v1.0.0
***
# Intro
The Chess Tournament Organizer is an app designed to illustrate the MVC design pattern.  The project is divided into three main components: models, views, and controllers.  The primary controller, the AppController, provides the entry point for the program.  In order to run the program, simply run "python src/main.py"

Each of the components are independent of each other, avoiding tight coupling and allowing clear separation of duties by adhering to the single responsibility principle.
